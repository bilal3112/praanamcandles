## üé® How to Customize

This website is designed to be easily customizable.

### 1. Updating Images

-   Place all your images inside the `assets/` folder.
-   Open `index.html` and `shop.html` in a text editor.
-   Find the `<img>` tags and replace the placeholder `src` paths (e.g., `assets/hero-background.png`) with the file names of your own images.
-   Make sure the product card `data-img` attributes are also updated with the correct image paths.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<img src="assets/mysore-sandalwood.png" alt="Mysore Sandalwood Candle">

<!-- After -->
<img src="assets/your-sandalwood-image.jpg" alt="Mysore Sandalwood Candle">
```

### 2. Updating Text and Prices

-   Open `index.html` and `shop.html`.
-   Locate the text you want to change (e.g., product descriptions, prices, testimonials).
-   Update the text directly in the HTML. For product cards, remember to update the text inside the `<h4>`, `<p>`, and `<span>` tags, as well as the `data-title`, `data-price`, and `data-description` attributes on the `view-btn` button to ensure the pop-up modal displays the correct information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript:** For interactive features like the mobile menu, product modal, and scroll animations.
